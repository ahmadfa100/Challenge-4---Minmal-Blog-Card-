# Challenge-4---Minmal-Blog-Card-
This project is a minimalist blog card design built using HTML and CSS. The goal was to practice creating aesthetically pleasing and readable card layouts. I learned how to use CSS properties like border-radius and box-shadow to enhance the visual appeal, and flexbox to structure the content effectively.
